## How to use

You can access the tool [here](https://amaro-dev.github.io/android-compare) and use the input box to select one or more devices you want to compare

## Device data

The device catalog was retrived from [PhoneDB](https://phonedb.net/) using the scrapper.py script that can be found on the tools folder

After gathering the devices, there's a filter process to void duplications and similarities
